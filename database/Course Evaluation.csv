"2019/04/17 3:50:00 PM EST","CS357","Mariana Silva","4","4","4","I think this course is quite important for a math students as it states a lot of useful stuff and it teaches python. The class is quite great and the homework is not hard on the coding part. All you need to do is to understand the theorom of the math part first and the coding is basically ask you about these theoroms. Not a big deal. ","Positive"
