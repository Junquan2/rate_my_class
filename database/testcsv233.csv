0,CS233,Awesome,"Personally, I disliked the material, but he gives humorous and informative lectures. He explains the subject and answers questions quite well. Lots of info and materials posted on the course website. This particular class starts out stupidly easy, but ramps up significantly through the semester, ESPECIALLY in the last few weeks. Don't slack!"
1,CS233,Awesome,Professor Zilles is a great lecturer and takes time to ask the class if they have any questions or needs clarification. I also had him for lab section and he is easy to talk to outside class.
2,CS233,Awesome,Prof. Zilles was awesome for lectures. He made a great environment for participation even in a large lecture . Very smart and always knew what he was talking about and was able to effectively answer all questions.
3,CS233,Awesome,Craig is a great professor. His lectures are well paced and he will stop and ask students if they have any questions (and actually scan the room) rather than just racing ahead through the lecture. I also had him for my discussion and he is helpful at explaining discussion problems.
4,CS233,Awesome,"He is a fantastic professor who is very good at explaining concepts, and always willing to answer your questions. But be sure to pay attention, because the class goes FAST, and the last 7 or 8 weeks covers a lot of challenging material! But all lectures are posted online, so it's not hard to learn the concepts you miss if you put in the time."
5,CS233,Awesome,best professor EVER!!!!!!!!
6,CS233,Awesome,"Craig is a wonderful teacher and amazing lecturer. He teaches well while also throwing in humor to keep you interested in the material. The class did seem to suffer from a lack of communication at times. However, I screwed up on an exam by incorrectly submitting part of it, and Craig allowed me to do a makeup assignment as to not ruin my grade."
7,CS233,Awful,"IMHO, the first 3/4's of this class is totally manageable. But around when midterm 6 hits, this class just went downhill. Not only that, we didn't really have much time to do SPIMBOT. Also, the last midterm was ridiculously hard (it's 20% of your grade) and studying from just course materials was not sufficient."
8,CS233,Awesome,"I'm very glad I took this course. I learned new things every day. This is the fairest course I've ever taken in terms of grading. That said, the lowest grade I've ever received was this class."
9,CS233,Awful,"Class is fairly easy except for the fact that you learn nothing in lecture and learn 95% of the material in 5 minutes of discussion and doing labs. Then, he ruins your grade on a last test worth 10% more than the final. Which he follows up by not telling you any information about what's on/the format of the final and you inevitably fail that."
10,CS233,Awesome,I LOVE CRAIG
11,CS233,Awesome,Awesome teacher. The best CS professor at UIUC by far. Very detailed in his instructions and teachings. I had him as a TA this past semester as well as the professor in lectures. He is just as good as a TA as he is as a professor. Funny guy too which keeps things entertaining.
12,CS233,Awesome,"Amazing professor - attend lectures and discussions! Well structured, extremely interesting. Lab assignments were helpful to see what we learned practically. Very clear in class, lots of office hours (prof + TA). Subject matter very useful in the real world and extremely interesting. Recommend it without hesitation - even if you're not a CS major!"
13,CS233,Awesome,"Zilles is awesome. Extremely clear, very interesting, everything you could want. This course is CS398 right now and was a little unorganized (understandable since the class is new)."
14,CS233,Awesome,"Extremely nice and likable guy. The material is interesting, he presents it well, and he's very entertaining without being over the top. Very knowledgeable about what he does, and has a quite generous grading system (all exams have a 'second chance' where you can retake questions)."
15,CS233,Awesome,"He's amazing. Knows how to talk, extremely knowledgeable, uniquely funny and enthusiastic. Very helpful (held a review session for a midterm at 7pm) and gets concepts across very well. The material itself was super interesting and makes you think differently. Highly recommend this class (if you're not a CS major; it's mandoatory for CS majors)"
16,CS233,Awesome,Awesome!!
17,CS233,Awesome,"Best professor on campus. If you can register for his discussion section, go for it! He's very helpful and explains things very well. Second-chance exams, extra credit from quizzes..."
18,CS233,Awesome,One of the best Professors I have ever seen in my life. Crystal clear teaching. Knows everything in his field. Makes class interesting with his teachings and jokes. Makes this class easy even though it's pretty hard
19,CS233,Awesome,"Amazing guy. Very smart, knowledgeable. Really cares about class and students. Unique sense of humor."
20,CS233,Awesome,"Despite the fact that Craig teaches my least favorite topic in CS (architecture), I still found him to be very enjoyable and his lectures informative. He's always well-prepared and really understands the subject well. He also teaches one of the discussions section (unheard of). One of the best professors at U of I, period."
21,CS233,Awesome,"By far the most amazing professor I've encountered at this university. Extremely knowledgeable, knows how to effectively convey that knowledge, and is super patient with questions after class. He really cares about his students and it shows."
22,CS233,Awesome,"Awesome, easygoing, funny professor."
23,CS233,Awesome,"The class is very interesting but hard. This probably is the first cs class that you can learn real stuff from and Craig knows a LOT. He can literally explain every single question you can possibly come up with. He's extremely helpful and cool, probably the best cs professor in the department lol"
24,CS233,Awesome,"By far one of the best professors I have ever had the pleasure of learning from. If you ever have the chance to take a course with him, do it ... you will not regret it!"
25,CS233,Awesome,"100% Heart, 100% of the time"
26,CS233,Awesome,Best professor at uiuc hands down. He really wants you to learn and will do everything in his power to do so. Very easy to talk to. He writes new exams and homeworks every semester. If only he taught more classes...
27,CS233,Awesome,"This guy reminds of Bill Gates, in a good way. Out of all CS Dept. teachers, he is by far the most interesting. He has won Engineering College teaching awards many times and will continue to do so with his dynamic and helpful style."
28,CS233,Awesome,"Definitely the best CS professor I've had so far at this university. He made me want to come to class every time, and that's saying a lot!"
29,CS233,Awesome,Great professor -- explanations are excellent. Wish't he taught more classes though.
30,CS233,Awesome,Best CS professor at UIUC by far!
31,CS233,Awful,too much difficult
32,CS233,Awesome,"Craig Zilles is one of the best profs. I've ever had! He's animated during lectures, has a great sense of humour, knows what he is talking about and is able to explain it very very clearly. Full marks"
33,CS233,Awesome,A very nice professor!!
34,CS233,Awesome,Cool and fun class!
