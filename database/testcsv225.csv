0,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda Heeren is best professor I have had at U of I she made cs 225 enjoyable despite the material being very challenging, the class has a lot of extra credit and it isn't that hard to get an B+ at least if not an A if you put in the time with the extra credit. Good luck if you're taking cs 225 next semester"
1,CS225,Awesome,"Great professor! Unlike Professor Fleck, Cinda makes the conceptually hard contents easy enough for us. Though there is a great amount of knowledge and workload, it is way more satisfying taking this course than CS173."
2,CS225,Awesome,"She's honestly one of the best lecturers in the CS department. There is a lot of extra credit in CS 225, so passing shouldn't be hard if you didn't struggle in CS 125. Learning the C++ language (even just basics) before taking the class can make things much easier on you, but isn't required."
3,CS225,Awesome,"The class was not really too difficult, but extremely time consuming, you can easily get an A if you put in the time"
4,CS225,Awesome,"Best course ever. You can tell she loves what she teaches, and she's good at teaching it. She cares about students very much. There is tons of extra credit - more than a letter grades' worth, so it's not even difficult to get an A as long as you put in time into the MPs and Labs."
5,CS225,Awesome,Dr. Heeren is AWESOME! Her lectures are very clear. She managed to cover the materials in detail. MPs and LABs are fun and useful. Tests are straight forward if you pay attention and spend time learning the content.
6,CS225,Awesome,"Lectures are clear and concise while still being in-depth, most of the course content is laid-out and easy to understand. You will have to sit down and think about the concepts but they're not bad at all. Professor Heeren is respectful and dedicates a lot of time to improve the course as a whole. Generous with extra credit, so DO IT."
7,CS225,Awesome,Great lecturer. The whole course is really awesome with helpful TAs and interesting MPs. Exams are generally fair. Tons of extra credits. Learnt a lot.
8,CS225,Awesome,She is an amazing professor with enthusiasm and entertainment. She loves to listen to students' questions and participation during lectures. She demonstrates and covers the materials well. TAs & piazza will help answer questions about the materials. MPs and labs takes time to complete and the class overall is not easy but worth it.
9,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is a great lecturer who is very enthusiastic and covers material well. The TAs & piazza will be your main source of help with questions on material/mps/labs. Though the MPs and material may be difficult, it is worth it. Plus, there's extra credit. Lectures are also online but on occasion slides can be glitchy. Work hard and it'll pay off."
10,CS225,Awesome,Cinda is an awesome professor! She made me fall in love with data structures and her class helped me land my first internship!
11,CS225,Awful,"She is enthusiastic but she is not a good communicator. In fact, you have better chance getting help from TAs. TAs are awesome. She barely replies to the emails. Don't get me wrong, she teaches well. My point is she doesn't help students who need help. Overall, I learned what I wanted to learn but it was a horrible experience."
12,CS225,Awesome,She was just awesome!
13,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is one of the best professors I've had. She's super chill and easy to talk to. Going to her class isn't necessary (lectures are online), but I benefitted a ton by going to lectures and asking questions. She understands your questions and gives great explanations. I have never written a review for a professor before but Cinda is worth it! :)"
14,CS225,Awesome,"Amazing woman! Tests are tough, but she loves what she does and is so passionate. Very approachable, and is very willing to answer questions. She knows her stuff and cares about her students. MPs are hard, but we're CS @ Illinois. You will learn a lot from Cinda and from going to lecture! Highly recommend her! One of my favorite teachers ever. :)"
15,CS225,Average,"I like how she is always excited to teach this class, but she speaks very slowly. And she goes over the material in a very slow pace making you feel that the course is very simple while the hw is accelerating rapidly in difficulty. The labs are very useful and fun, though. She also takes a lot of questions which makes the class a little boring."
16,CS225,Awful,"Granted, Professor Heeren is very enthusiastic about teaching and this course, however I did not enjoy my experience in this class at all. Professor Heeren attempts (unsuccessfully so) to keep lectures interesting through jokes tangents that actually distract. She also refuses to release answers to the previous exams making studying impossible."
17,CS225,Awesome,"Always so enthusiastic and willing to help students. But the course is tough, if not required by ur major i dont recommend taking 225. BTW, dont cheat on code, she will know and the consequence is harsh."
18,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is amazing. Data Structures, with her at the helm, has been the best class I've had at UIUC. It's one of the few that has really made me feel like I'm actually in a world class program. She will challenge you but also give you all the tools you need to succeed."
19,CS225,Awesome,A great teacher! She really cares about her students and wants them to learn. Love her!
20,CS225,Awesome,"She's a pretty good lecturer. Only complaint is that she goes past the end of class and expects you to stay, despite needing to get to other classes. Very enthusiastic, which is a plus."
21,CS225,Awesome,Best lecturer I've ever had in any class. Amazing.
22,CS225,Awesome,Excellent Teacher. My best class in uiuc only because of Cinda!
23,CS225,Awesome,Great lecturer! Very enthusiastic and tries her best to keep the class engaged. MPs can be a bit challenging at times but Cinda and the 225 course staff were always willing to help.
24,CS225,Awesome,"Very fun professor. The course was challenging, but there is a lot of extra credit available. The exams were fair. Her teaching style is fun and clear, but goes through material quick. She is perfectly willing to help out other students."
25,CS225,Average,Tries to be funny and bubbly but overdoes it to the extent of being unclear. Needs to be more focused on teaching than cracking jokes
26,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is a Wonderful teacher. It was her teaching style that made Data Structures seem so much more accessible. She's lively, bubbly, and VERY knowledgeable. Approachable too, always willing to help. Also she cracks corny jokes... but best part is that she KNOWS they're corny which makes it stupid funny- the best type of funny. Epic teacher overall"
27,CS225,Average,Like a boss
28,CS225,Awesome,"Probably one of my favorite classes at UIUC. Her lectures made the subject extremely interesting and I found them quite enjoyable. I would highly recommend her as a professor. Her class was pleasantly challenging, not easy but very doable."
29,CS225,Awesome,"You can tell she really loves her job. Very cheerful while teaching and promotes a fun atmosphere to be in which makes lectures more enjoyable, even if they go a bit slow at times."
30,CS225,Awful,"Enthusiastic, but sometimes gets annoying.... Her narration of subjects are really confusing. Need to pay close attention, especially proofs"
31,CS225,Awesome,Extremely enthusiastic! One of the rare professor you will find at UIUC. She is extremely kind and her exams are fair. She often times makes jokes indirectly :)
32,CS225,Awesome,"Extremely helpful, clear, fun - I'm in love with this professor!"
33,CS225,Awesome,very nice instructor
34,CS225,Awesome,"The best prof I've had yet, she has great aids, is cheerful (sometimes a bit too much) and enthusiastic, the quality of the class in itself is really high, and together with her and the TA's help, one ends up learning a ton of stuff. Must take class and professor for anyone looking a good C++ background. MP's are hard and time consuming though."
35,CS225,Awesome,I took the class a while back then (it was i think fall 09). She's pretty awesome .. She's friendly and very &quot;active&quot; while lecturing - don't expect the normal boring talking-to-him/herself professor! Cinda has perfected 225 with her charisma & new ideas! THere's even a Facebook Page for CS225 where they now upload videos for MP related tutorial!
36,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda doesn't spend as much time on the course as much as other top professors that I've had, but she's an excellent lecturer. Other reviewers have criticized her knowledge of the material, but at the very least she has the concepts down pat."
37,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is fantastic at teaching CS225, and she's very passionate about making sure students learn. CS225 requires a lot of time-consuming work, but it's not too difficult if you put the time in."
38,CS225,Awesome,She is very funny and nice!
39,CS225,Awesome,hot
40,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is a genius. Her lectures are pretty clear given that some of the data structure implementations aren't intuitive. She is always willing to help if you seek her out. The class demands a lot of work, but is rewarding."
41,CS225,Awesome,Cinda is more than willing to help each one of her students and her exams are fair. Her lectures are interesting and she is able to keep your attention very well. I recommend!!
42,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda Heeren is a great professor. She knows the course content and beyond very well, makes class fun and entertaining, and is considerate of the students. She is clearly enthusiastic about what she's teaching. This was my favorite class I've taken at this university, and I think most of the credit for that is due to the instructor."
43,CS225,Awesome,"Cinda is a great teacher that teaches the class in a structured and organized way. Whenever she teaches a data structure, she goes over why we need the data structure fist. This helps understand why we need the data structure and really helps us understand how and why they work. Cinda teaches the class well."
44,CS225,Awesome,"Her classes are hard (her exams and MPs are almost insane!), and she is not the most organized person to teach the subject matter. However, her enthusiasm in this subject, along with the fact that she's always willing to help makes her a really good professor. Though some people does not like her, I would strongly recommend her."
45,CS225,Awesome,she is one of the best teachers i ve come across.. simply the best!
46,CS225,Awful,"Umm...Cinda doesn't know data structures and she doesn't know how to write tests (avg. score was ~60%). With the useless TA's, I think a lot of people relied on the Internet and each other to get through this class."
47,CS225,Average,"Pretty good instructor. Lacks the ability to explain things clearly, but is very enthusiastic and always responds to students. Makes the class fun, even thougth it is hard to understand what is goin on sometimes. Overall, pretty good professor. I would take her again if given a choice"
48,CS225,Awesome,"Easy concepts taught in the lecture, but the machine problems you do can get very difficult and the tests are definitely not simple at all."
49,CS225,Awesome,"A decent teacher. It seems like she's a little inexperienced and is not the best at explaining things or organizing, but she's friendly and approachable and tries to help however she can. The material itself isn't particularly difficult, so I think she suits the class well enough."
50,CS225,Awesome,"The course itself is a bit hard with a lot MPs. But I think she (and her TAs) did a good job. She covered the whole material, and asnwered questions whenever asked. She's slow in responding to emails, which may be fair because she should recieve lots of them. It was her first time teaching this course, hence some problems. but overal a good one"
51,CS225,Awful,A totally pathetic class with the instructor clueless abt what she is teaching. Officially asking students to cheat on MPs to make up for her incompetencies was not a good idea. Also the corrections are totally inconsistent and no sample solutions for examsare provided to help. It is a shame that CS dept offers this low standard of teaching...
