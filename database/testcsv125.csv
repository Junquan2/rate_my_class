1,CS125,Awesome,This professor and this class inspired me to transfer into Computer Science.
2,CS125,Awesome,"Great Professor, first time programming and managed an A-. Took a bit of work though. If you have had rigorous experience with recursion, this class might be a joke to you. Take it anyway , Angrave is the bee's knees."
3,CS125,Average,"Each lecture was trying to decipher his analogies than actually learning the material. It's my first time coding, and I don't think it's an easy class. Need to be able to devote a lot of time to do well if you don't pick up on stuff that easily. Midterms 2 and 3 were pretty hard, so be sure you have time for this class!"
4,CS125,Awesome,The Best CS Professor on campus
5,CS125,Awesome,"Angrave is a great professor. He definitely does his best to keep the class interesting, and he does a great job of it. The MPs are helpful and the tests are fair. Overall, its a very easy class if you have prior programming experience, but definitely doable even if you don't. Very nice, funny, and intelligent professor."
6,CS125,Awesome,Awesome Professor! Really put a lot of effort into making the course an amazing CS introductory course. Definitely learnt a lot and the MPs given were very interesting as well!
7,CS125,Awesome,"Wat a guy. If youre reading this, angrave, give yourself a pat on the back"
8,CS125,Awesome,One word: awesome.
9,CS125,Awesome,"You can really tell he is passionate about CS and teaching his students. Not only that, but he is also extremely intelligent and funny. He is everything you could ever want in a Professor."
10,CS125,Awesome,"My first time programming, Angrave made it a breeze! this class is one of the best classes ever!"
11,CS125,Awesome,best class I have ever take in my freshman year in UofI
12,CS125,Awesome,"Overall excellent professor! It's a CS course, so don't expect it to be easy, but he is so enthusiastic that it makes going to lecture fun--and extremely useful!"
13,CS125,Awesome,He is great and funny. Love his British accent. I can't be more thankful that taking this course with him inspired me to transfer to computer science major.
14,CS125,Awesome,This guy is incredible.
15,CS125,Awesome,Lawrence Angrave: the most entertaining CS professor you will ever have.
16,CS125,Awesome,Excellent teacher. Not only is he extremely funny but makes sure that the class gets a firm grip on the concepts.
17,CS125,Awesome,"Seldom am I inspired to do anything non-mandatory, but this teacher is so inspiring, teaches so incredibly well, and gives the students every possible tool they could use to pass this class that I felt the need to tell everyone here. If possibly, take this class."
18,CS125,Awesome,What an unbelievable guy. I had him my freshman year at UIUC and he truly inspired me to go into computer science while providing me with a solid foundation to stem from. I'm a software Engineer at Google now and couldnt be more thankful to Angrave for starting it all off.
19,CS125,Awesome,"He's charismatic and helpful. He might make you want to switch to CS at the end of it all. As far as the class goes, it might be difficult for the non-technically minded, but all the resources are there to help (lectures, readings, section, office hours, debug your brain, piazza for constant web support), and grading is almost too forgiving. If you don't manage at least a B in this class with some fair effort CS might not be for you."
20,CS125,Awesome,He is awesome!!!!
21,CS125,Awesome,"Hilarious professor and made lectures interesting. Lectures aren't mandatory but they're helpful and interesting. The MPs can be tough but he regrades them for full credit the following week. Overall, interesting class but without prior Java experience it won't be easy."
22,CS125,Awesome,Angrave made my love computer science! I really suggest taking his class even if you don't think you're interested in CS! He is a fantastic teacher.
23,CS125,Awesome,Best professor I will ever have in my Career as a Student. Shows us funny videos before every class and just keeps joking around to make sure that we do indeed focus in class. He knows how to make fun and work Mix..he has a childlike enthusiasm. Do your Readings and MP's in advance and you will experience the best class in the history of UIUC.
24,CS125,Awesome,Makes CS fun and can answer any question.
25,CS125,Awesome,He's a complete baller. This class was really fun to go to every day. He is loud exciting and funny and truly makes an effort to make the class fun. He also has a british accent.
26,CS125,Awesome,hilarious/crazy guy. he dressed up like a pirate and talked like one for a day. got on top of desks and more. Take his class!!
27,CS125,Awesome,So Funny
28,CS125,Awesome,"A fantastic professor--he teaches the introduction to CS for everyone in the department for a reason. He expects a lot from you, but the class never feels hard (although you'll probably do a lot of work for it). Even with no prior programming experience, I aced the class and had a lot of fun."
29,CS125,Awesome,"Angrave is literally the best professor on campus. Always enthusiastic, always knowledgeable, and always looking to help his students. Great man."
30,CS125,Awesome,"If you are thinking about majoring, or even minoring, in CS, you have to take this class with Angrave. Not that you have a choice really, but there's definitely no one better to teach you for this course. :)"
31,CS125,Awesome,One of the best professors ever.
32,CS125,Awesome,"Angrave is fast-praced with high expectations but entirely engaging. There is always help when you need it though. Discussion counts for points (reinforcing worksheets and then a computer-based lab), so go to them. Don't put off your exercises or MPs! I highly recommend having prior programming experience, as most people in the class do."
33,CS125,Awesome,"Angrave tried to interact with the class, keeping class interesting most of the time. The MP's progressively got more difficult, and he expected you to understand everything very quickly. If you needed help, there was always someone to help. Overall he was a good professor. Keep up with class, do practice exams to be prepared for the tests."
34,CS125,Awesome,A legend among professors. Surely the best professor ever.
35,CS125,Awesome,BEST TEACHER ANYONE CAN HAVE. PERIOD.
36,CS125,Awesome,Makes the material not only interesting but fun to understand and gives plenty of help in understanding concepts. Awesome Teacher! Take his class if you have any interest in coding.
37,CS125,Awesome,"Angrave's the best prof I've ever had. If you haven't seen the material before, you're going to have to work your butt off. The grading is fair and there are practice exams, so it is possible to do well if you don't have prior programming experience. However, don't even consider this is you're just looking for an easy Quant 1."
38,CS125,Awesome,not a hard course.just stay with the class and remember to do the practice exams.
39,CS125,Awesome,"Best professor, ever, period."
40,CS125,Awesome,"The man, myth and legend, Lawrence Angrave is the best professor you will ever have in college."
41,CS125,Awesome,"Fantastic professor, very helpful, approachable, and willing to give his time to his students!"
42,CS125,Awesome,I absolutely love and adore him!He is the best professor ever....and is really cute too lol! but besides that fact he makes class sooo much fun that people who even hate computer science would fall in love! take him for sure!
43,CS125,Awesome,One of the best professors I've had!
44,CS125,Awesome,"Pretty good professor. Lectures can be somewhat vague, but there are plenty of office hours and online resources to help out. He's got a good sense of humor, and manages to keep things interesting."
45,CS125,Awesome,awesome class!
46,CS125,Awesome,He is an awesome professor. He makes his class so much fun and has cool jokes and tricks in every one of his classes. Attendance is not mandatory per se but u cannot succeed without attending his lectures which I always look forward to. Probably one of the best professors in the whole university.
47,CS125,Awesome,"OMG! what an amazing professor, enjoy his show!"
48,CS125,Awesome,"Lectures are fun, but at times I have a hard time keeping up with what he's saying, I think it's the australian accent haha. The exams are okay and the MPs get harder throughout the semester, so be careful."
49,CS125,Awesome,"He makes lectures enjoyable and is also very willing to answer questions during or after lectures. Grading is fair. Do all the mps and you'll be fine. Overall, best class to take at U of I!!!I totally enjoy this class. ps; I didn't have any programming experience prior taking this class. It's not that hard as it might sound."
50,CS125,Awesome,I want to give him a hug.
51,CS125,Awesome,Probably the best professor I have ever known. the class is really fun and he has a good sense of humor. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities (I ended up with over a 100% score).
52,CS125,Awesome,"Lawrence Angrave is the best computer science teacher I have ever had. He has a real passion for what he does and I highly recommend taking this course if you are looking for a good cs class to take. Be forewarned, there are weekly MPs (Machineproblems) due each Monday at 8 pm, and they require around 3-8 hours of work, depending on your experience"
53,CS125,Awesome,He was a fantastic lecturer. This class was amazing and truly reccomend it to others. He made me excited to attend class.
54,CS125,Awesome,"Awesome Professor and an awesome lecturer. He's very upbeat which helps keep my attention, very clear, and he's always open for questions in the lecture and before/after the lecture."
55,CS125,Awesome,"if you're having a bad day (or a good day) go to class. angrave is fun, quirky, inspiration, and quite an idealist. lots of talk about true love and zombies. if you sit in the front you will be called out for examples. if you haven't programmed before it will be difficult but if you're willing to put in the time i definitely recommend the class"
56,CS125,Average,not bad
57,CS125,Average,"Very enthusiastic, and helps get you excited about the material. His teaching style is very visual and memorable, so if his explanations click, they really stay with you. But I felt that his explanations tended to lack clarity, and I may have been confused if I didn't know most of the material. But he makes up for it by offering lots of re-grades."
58,CS125,Awesome,I highly recommend Prof. Angrave. He clearly loves what he does and knows a lot about Java. I had not known anything about the subject before taking this class and he made it seem easy and helped a lot. I actually stopped doing the readings halfway through the semester and he lectures were clear enough for me to get an A.
59,CS125,Awesome,"Pretty easy class. Professor was funny when I went, but going to class certainly is not necessary. As long as you do a couple hours of work each week there is no excuse to not get an A."
60,CS125,Awesome,great
61,CS125,Awesome,wheee
62,CS125,Awesome,Unusually humorous and highly understandable - that's a gem for computer science professors!
63,CS125,Awesome,"Not really that good at explaining. If I didn't know anything about CS before taking this class, I would have had a hard time. He spends the whole class joking and teaches very little, yet wants you to go to every lecture as if it's incredibly important."
64,CS125,Awesome,"Very charismatic and excited about the subject, and in that sense he gets you excited as well. He does seem many times to spend more time trying to entertain the students than actually effectively teach matter. A lot of students have to rely on others and the internet a lot of the time to understand topics in the MPs."
65,CS125,Awesome,"One of the most charismatic teachers at the Universitiy. He loves his work, and he'll make you love it too. While it was one of my trickier classes, it was the only class I loved to attend. Lectures are riddled with jokes and demonstrations. The difficult and abstract subject matter is make quite simple. Highly recommend Prof. Angrave."
66,CS125,Awesome,"A charismatic teacher that really knows his stuff. He tries to lighten up lectures by telling corny jokes and letting students to interact with each other. Could be a bit better while explaining concepts, but he has brought many students a long way and is one of the best."
67,CS125,Awesome,Always made himself available and was a lot of fun to listen to during lectures. Truly a great proffessor
68,CS125,Awesome,"He's a great teacher, clearly in love with his work and tries to make the students fall in love with CS as well. Always incredibly interesting and funny (in a cheesy way). And you can't go wrong with that accent! Ow ow!"
69,CS125,Awesome,"Great professor! Very experienced in not only the course material, but it's applications as well(he had two start ups before, one was bought by EA and I forgot about the other). Has great interest in teaching, and good clarity. MPs are neither hard nor easy, but plain fun. Highly recommended."
70,CS125,Awesome,Good professor. I would recommend him
71,CS125,Awesome,This guy is awesome.
72,CS125,Awesome,I loved it when he took the floor. He is so charismatic and can make hard concepts seem simple. He can really get you motivated about computer science and relates all the things you'll learn in his class to upper level courses. He also brings in guest speakers. The projects you do are challenging but practical. He's one of the best.
